# Tail Number Search

## Introduction
Welcome! This is a simple python application that will allow
you to search for a tail number from a past flight. So far, this
application only supports domestic flights taken over 3 months ago
(and as far back as 1993).
You will need:

**(a)** The flight number

**(b)** The origin airport

**(c)** The date you took the flight

## How to use
You can download and import helper.py into any instance of Python 3.
I've included an IPython notebook with a demonstration on how to run
the app. You only need an active internet connection for the app
to work properly.
